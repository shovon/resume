  \begin{cvsection}{Profile}
    I am a software engineer, with a passion for programming. I am always looking to improve my programming skills, by either solving project euler problems, reading white papers, or meeting other fellow programmers. I have also worked on a system that collected telemetry data from a house, ensuring reliability and accuracy in the collected data.
