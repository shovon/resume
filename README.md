# resume

This is my resume. There's nothing else to it. Feel free to fork it, and use it on your own resume, if you so wish.

You just need to have either TeX Live or MacTex (on OS X) installed.

To make life easier, I've also included a Makefile. Just run `make` and it should build both the resume and cover letter.
